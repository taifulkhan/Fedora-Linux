Introduction  

No matter from which background you come from , a regular computer user, a system administrator or software developer , learning Linux is the best time investment you have made. Why ? Because as  a  Linux user you have the freedom to run , change, redistribute  a computer program as you wish. Isn't that amazing ! 

One of the first step to become an expert Linux user is to learn the commands. Surely you can do a lot of task with graphical user interface. But commands give you the flexibility and power to do a task quickly. 

Unfortunately there are lack of well organized resources  online where you can find all the useful commands you need as a beginner. When I searched for useful commands online , I found that most of them are not properly categorized  so that a user can learn gradually from the beginning. 
 
Hence I decided to make a list of Linux commands in 5 different category so that you can easily go through and learn them quickly. However , keep in mind that the main purpose if this list is give you a general idea how some of the basic Linux commands works and most importantly where can you find a command to solve a problem by yourself. By the time you practice all of the command described here you will have a pretty good idea how commands work in Linux.

Important Note 

All the commands presented here are tested in Fedora 28, a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project. You might ask why did I choose Fedora over other distribution? Well that is a discussion topic for another day. However you can choose any distribution of your choice. Almost 80% of the command will work just fine in any other distribution. For other 20% you have to take help from online to find the alternate commands.
